## Executive Summary
I specialize in taking "impossible" technologies and turning them into consumer-grade products. With a background spanning 20+ years, 6 Patents, and 1 Billion+ app downloads, I bridge the gap between hard engineering and seamless User Experience.

My career is defined by being early to platform shifts: Mobile (2008), AR/XR (2011), Spatial Streaming (2022), and now Agentic AI (2025). I do not just manage products; I architect the ecosystems that make them possible.

## Core Competencies
* **Leadership:** Product Strategy, Go-to-Market (GTM), Fundraising (Seed to Series B), M&A Integration, Team Building.
* **Technical Stack:** Agentic AI, Local LLMs, Rust, Python, Computer Vision, NeRFs, Spatial Computing.
* **Domain Expertise:** Privacy-First Architecture, Volumetric Streaming, Hardware-Software Integration (Phygital), Mobile Ecosystems.
