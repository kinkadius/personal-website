# Kyle Kinkade
**CPO & Founder | Product Executive in AI, Spatial Computing & XR | Inventor**

I specialize in taking emerging technologies and turning them into consumer-grade products. With a background spanning 20+ years, 6 Patents, and 1 Billion+ app downloads, I bridge the gap between engineering and User Experience. My career is defined by being early to platform shifts: Mobile (2008), Wearables (2012), AR/XR (2016), and now Agentic AI (2025).
